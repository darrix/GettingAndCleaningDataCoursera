# GettingAndCleaningDataCoursera

# Introduction #
This submission is for the Getting and Cleaning Data course in the Coursera Data Science curriculum.  

It makes use of Samsung data taken from [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The steps involved with this assignment were

* Retrieve the required data
* Create an R script which would
	* Merge the test and training data sets
	* Create a tidy data set consisting of only mean and std features
	* Create a second tidy data set consisting of the average value of each feature by subject and activity
* In addition, we have to create a codebook describing the tidy sets and the the tidy process

# Prerequisites 

The script in this repository, run_analysis.R, assumes that the Samsung data has been retrieved from [this location,](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) into the R working directory.  Additionally, it assumes that the directory name "UCI HAR Dataset" has been renamed to "Samsung."
